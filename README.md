# Image Classifier

This project uses PyTorch to develop an image classifier which is able to determine the names of flowers in a given image. It is part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program, and built for that purpose. 

The first part of the project was to develop the classifier within a Jupyter Notebook environment to ensure it was able to successfully run. The second part of the project was to implement the classifier in a Command Line Application. With the Command Line Application, the user could either Train the classifier or use a saved checkpoint to Predict the name of a flower in a provided image. Within both applications, the user is able to provide a number of parameters, or proceed with the defaults.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This project will be using this [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of images. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
